## About the Software Development Kit

This repository contains free and open source code for a Software Development Kit (SDK) that can be used by third-party developers to integrate Shift iQ into their own applications, libraries, and business intelligence reporting tools.

> Please note this SDK is undergoing a significant overhaul to improve its performance and security, and to provide developers with a much wider and much richer set of features. Therefore, it is subject to change. This readme will be updated whenever updates to the SDK are posted.

The SDK communicates with the Shift platform through an open [REST API](https://restfulapi.net). It includes sample code for Microsoft [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us) and [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48). Of course, you are not limited to using Microsoft .NET in your implementations. The API is accessible using any programming language that supports [HTTPS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2818) requests and [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) responses; for example: [cURL](https://curl.se), [Go](https://go.dev), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [PHP](https://www.php.net), [Power Query M](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m), [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en).
